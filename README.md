# CompanyEmployees

## Overview
The "CompanyEmployees" project exemplifies a robust implementation of the Onion Architecture in C#. This architectural pattern emphasizes a modular and layered approach to software design, promoting separation of concerns and maintainability.

## Key Features

- **Onion Architecture:** Structured into layers (Core, Infrastructure, Application, Presentation) to facilitate scalability and maintainability.
- **Modular Design:** Each layer serves a distinct purpose, from core business logic to external interfaces, ensuring clear separation of concerns.
- **Dependency Injection:** Leveraging .NET's built-in DI container for loosely coupled components, enhancing testability and flexibility.
- **Entity Framework Core:** Persistence layer managed with EF Core for data access, supporting various database providers.
- **RESTful API:** Includes API endpoints for managing employees, leveraging ASP.NET Core for robust web services.
- **Swagger Documentation:** Integrated Swagger UI for API documentation, easing exploration and testing of endpoints.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Secure endpoints using JWT tokens and role-based access control (RBAC), ensuring data protection.
- **Unit Testing:** Implemented unit tests to validate business logic and ensure code reliability.

## Purpose
This repository serves as a comprehensive example of implementing Onion Architecture principles in a real-world C# application. It provides a foundational structure for building scalable and maintainable enterprise-grade software solutions.
